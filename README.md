# ColonPolyps_Detection
Codes and key procedures to construct a ColonPolyps detection system based on [YOLOv3 architecture](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). All procedures below are on `Linux` with CUDA installed.
## Preparatory Steps
### Step 1: Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 model
Run the codes below in the command line to have Darknet installed:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
cd darknet
make
```
### Step 2: Create neccessary files
First, create folder `VOCdevkit\Colonpolyps\` in the current directory. Then, go to the `VOCdevkit\Colonpolyps\` directory, and create four folders: `Annotations\`, `ImageSets\`, `JPEGImages\`, `labels\`. Details of the four folders are shown below:
* `Annotations\`
Contains xml documents of the images

Each xml document displays labels of an image. Labels includes size of the image, names of the objects, locations of the objects.Â  See an example below:
